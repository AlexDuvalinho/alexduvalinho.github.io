### Bio

I am a PhD Student at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay) under the supervision of [Prof. Fragkiskos Malliaros](https://fragkiskos.me/). From the start of 2022, I have also been attached to [MILA](https://mila.quebec/) (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Insitute), under the supervision of [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) and [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/), as part of the group "AI for Climate Change". 

My research spans the broad field of Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), i.e. an area of ML which focuses on non-euclidean data (e.g. graphs). After several projects on the explicability of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), graph pooling algorithms and graph-based text summarisation, I bifurcated towards projects using Graph ML to accelerate scientific discovery. In particular, I am working on electrocatalyst design to improve the energy efficiency of hydrogen storage, cement production and other energy-intensive industrial processes. This ambitious project first involves constructing scalable and expressive symmetry-preserving GNN architectures for materials modelling, before combining them with generative methods (e.g. GFlowNets) to both propose and evaluate new catalyst materials in an end-to-end pipeline.

In my spare time, I love playing football as well as a wide range of other outdoor activities. I am also a genuine art enthousiast, including painting, cinema and music.

<!-- In particular, I try to reduce the energy consumption (i.e. the carbon footprint) of multiple human industrial activities, such as cement production, fertiliser production, or electro fuel production. Since these processes all rely on electrochemical reactions, we propose to optimise their energetic efficiency by finding new catalysts materials. More concretly, I design simple, fast and expressive symmetry-preserving GNN architectures for materials modelling. I then aim to combine them with generative methods (e.g. GFlowNets) to both propose and evaluate new catalyst materials in an end-to-end pipeline. -->

<!-- This is where my research comes into play. My thesis is about teaching a machine learning model to predict how good a proposed catalyst is for a given reaction. To do this, I designed a graph neural network model, embedded it with the laws of physics, and trained it on a huge dataset created by chemists based on years of research. In the end, it estimates in seconds, instead of days, how good the selected catalyst is. At this stage though, I can only test a handful of manually selected catalysts candidates. How can I expand to testing millions of possible catalysts? I actually decided to couple this GNN model with a generative model, which allows us to cleverly sample/generates plausible catalysts. The result is an automated pipeline, where we propose and evaluate new catalysts for every useful chemical reaction in the world. In the end, I only output the most promising candidates and then send them to chemistry labs for real-world experiments.

Ultimately, I hope my research will be used to revolutionise as many industrial activities as possible. It has the potential to decrease by several factors the amount of energy needed to perform so many of the processes we rely on in our modern-day society, drastically reducing our carbon emissions worldwide. -->
